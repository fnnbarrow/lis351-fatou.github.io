		<p> First originating and performed by African American artists, RnB or R&B is one of the most popular music genres in the United States and recently across the world. RnB stands for Rhythm and Blues which not only describes the elements of the genre but also the origination. RnB combines elements such as Jazz, Gospel, and Blues as influences as well as typical instruments such as a guitar, bass, saxophone, drum kit, and keyboard that make up it as a genre. The term "Rhythm and Blues" has been used as an umbrella term to "refer to any music made by and for Black Americans". It is also used a term used to describe how RnB is a genre that uses a certain style of music that uses a 12 bar blues format and boogie-woogie with a back beat, though this has since evolved. The original rhythm and blues genre first came about in the 1940s, gaining traction in the 1950s in places such as New Orleans. Many groups such as The Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds were considered RnB bands at the start of their careers in the 1960s.  </p> <cite> Source: "https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/r/Rhythm_and_blues.htm"
